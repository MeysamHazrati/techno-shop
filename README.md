Techno Shop is an online shop website designed for digital products. The project includes both server and client sides, and I am the developer for both 🫡

I hope you enjoy using it ♥️

## Demo 🌪

This project is currently under development!

## Let's Get Started 🚀

First, go to the `server` directory and run the server:

```bash
cd server

npm run dev
```

Then, repeat the same process for the `client`:

```bash
cd client

npm run dev
```

That's it! Now, you can use this website on your system ✌️
